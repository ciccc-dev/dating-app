# Dating App

Welcome to the Dating App! This app aims to provide users with a unique and engaging experience when it comes to finding potential matches. With the "One out of Three" feature, users can choose a person they want to contact from a pool of three options. This feature offers several advantages over traditional dating apps:

## Features

### Easy Comparison of Users

By presenting users with three options to choose from, it becomes easier for them to compare different profiles. This makes it convenient to evaluate potential matches based on their preferences, interests, and other relevant information. Users can make an informed decision and select the person they feel most compatible with.

### Higher Chance of Messaging

With the "One out of Three" feature, users have a higher chance of receiving messages compared to other dating apps. Since the selection is narrowed down to three candidates, the likelihood of a user receiving a message increases. This creates a more dynamic and engaging environment for users to connect with each other.

### Feeling Special as the Chosen Candidate

When a user receives a message from another user who has chosen them as their preferred candidate, it creates a sense of being special. Being selected out of a pool of options enhances the user's confidence and makes the interaction more meaningful. It adds a personal touch to the dating experience and increases the chances of developing a genuine connection.

### Reduced Incidence of Trolling

By limiting the options to three candidates, the "One out of Three" feature helps reduce the incidence of trolling or inappropriate behavior that can be prevalent on some dating apps. Since users have to make a conscious choice, the likelihood of spam or malicious interactions is minimized, creating a safer and more positive environment for all users.
